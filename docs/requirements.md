# Requirements Specification (Updated)

**1. Problem Statement:**

The application aims to solve the "IQ Puzzler Pro" game, which involves placing a set of 2D pieces, composed of 3-5 connected balls, into a 3D pyramid shape. The pyramid consists of five layers, each a square grid with a decreasing size (5x5, 4x4, 3x3, 2x2, 1x1), with adjacent layers shifted by half an index. The application must determine the correct placement and orientation of all given pieces such that they perfectly fill the pyramid without overlap or any balls extending beyond the pyramid's boundaries. **Furthermore, the application must verify that any initially provided placement of pieces is strictly adhered to in the final solution.**

**2. Functional Requirements:**

* The application must take as input an initial, potentially partial, placement of some pieces within the pyramid. This input will specify the color of the piece and the location(s) of its constituent balls.
* The application must find a valid arrangement of all the provided puzzle pieces that completely fills the 3D pyramid structure, respecting the layer shifts and the shape of the pyramid.
* The application must verify that no two pieces overlap in their placement.
* The application must ensure that no part of any placed piece extends beyond the defined boundaries of the 5-layer pyramid.
* The application should be able to output the final solution, indicating the placement (location and orientation) of each piece.
* The application should indicate if no solution can be found for a given initial placement.

**3. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* The application should initially be a command-line interface (CLI) tool.
* The application's architecture should be designed to allow for the future integration of a visualization frontend.
* The core solving logic should be modular to allow for the potential replacement of the solving algorithm in the future.
* Individual puzzle pieces are uniquely identified by their color. The set of available pieces and their shapes will be predefined within the application.
* **Runtime performance is a concern and needs to be considered during the implementation of the solving algorithm and data structures.**

**4. Constraints:**

* All given puzzle pieces must be used in the solution; no pieces can be left over.
* The shapes of the individual pieces are fixed and known.
* The dimensions and structure of the 5-layer pyramid are fixed.
* The layer shift between adjacent layers is a fixed half-index offset.
* Pieces can be placed within a single layer or diagonally across multiple layers.
* For initial placement input, the application must respect the provided colors and locations.
